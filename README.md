# Summy

Summy is a Chrome extension that uses generative AI to provide quick, insightful summaries of web pages.

Upon user request, Summy extracts the main content from a given webpage and uses an LLM of choice to generate a concise summary along with relevant context.

Summy runs inside the browser. It interacts with the LLM provider of your choice but does not send any data elsewhere.

## Features

- üöÄ One-click webpage summarization
- üåê Multi-language support with automatic language detection and matching
- üè∑Ô∏è Smart content categorization
- üìä Content analysis with stress level score
- üòä Emoji representation of content themes
- üí° Auto-generated follow-up questions and answers
- ‚ùì Ask your own questions about the webpage content in the language of your choice

### AI Integration
Summy supports multiple LLMs including:
  - Google Gemini
  - Anthropic Claude
  - OpenAI
  - DeepSeek
  - Groq
  - Ollama
  - xAI

## Installation

Summy is not yet listed in the Chrome Web Store. For the time being, see [Development](#development) on how to build and install the extension.

## Architecture

Summy uses a hybrid architecture:

- **WASM Module**: Rust code compiled to WebAssembly handles the core summarization logic and interaction with LLMs
- **Options Page**: JavaScript directly interacting with the WASM module
- **Content Script**: JavaScript interacting with the WASM module via a service worker

```bash
cargo build
```

2. Build the extension:
```bash
npm run dev      # Development build
npm run release  # Production build
```
