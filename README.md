- **WebAssembly Module**: Rust compiled to WebAssembly (executed within the browser)
- **AI Integration**: Multiple LLM support including:
  - Google Gemini
  - Anthropic Claude
  - DeepSeek
  - OpenAI
  - Groq
  - Ollama
  - xAI

```

## Architecture

Summy uses a hybrid architecture:

- **WASM Module**: Rust code compiled to WebAssembly handles the core summarization logic and interaction with LLMs
- **Options Page**: JavaScript directly interacting with the WASM module
- **Content Script**: JavaScript interacting with the WASM module via a service worker

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cargo build
```

2. Build the extension:
```bash
npm run dev      # Development build
npm run release  # Production build
```

3. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Open `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `extension` directory

## Usage

1. Click the Summy icon in your browser toolbar or use the context menu
2. Wait for the AI to process the page content
3. View the summary with additional insights in the overlay

## Configuration
